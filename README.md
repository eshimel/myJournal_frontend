#MyJournal The App

##Use MyJournal as a tool to keep a personal account of the what's happening in your life.  You can  pull up a list of all of your entries, delete previous entries, and rename an entry, if your writing goes in a different direction than when you first started your post.  Sorry, no going back in and editing a post.  It’s like a paper journal, you'll just have to "rip out the page" by deleting it.  A future feature will be the “rate my day” quick post, that gives users the option to give a quick 1-10 rating of how they feel their day is going.
This app was inspired by an area art therapy organization’s daily check-in/check-out protocols.  I spent the last year prior to becoming a developer working with this after school program, as well as others on the north shore.

#User Stories

As a user, the primary user, I need to be able to easily use the web console so that I can debug and troubleshoot the application that I am writing.
This frontend design of this app has been designed with using the bootstrap framework, specifically for a mobile app.  The reason is so that it was easier to see the workings of the app with the web console displayed larger.
As a user, the not me user, I need to see how the app works, so that I can decide whether to I want to register to use it.

As a user, I need to login, so that I can create entries.

As a user, I need to write entries, so that I can add to my journal.

As a user, I need to see past entries, so that I can review what I wrote.

As a user, I need to update titles, so that I can make my personal narrative sound more awesome.


As a user, I need to delete entries, so that I can have the satisfaction that mirrors ripping pages out of a paper  journal.

#Wireframes and Supporting Images

##Why I think making a "small' app is useful!  Note the awesome size of the console.

## Issues/Next Steps to work on:

The list button lists all entries when not logged in...its an issue with the open_read controller that needs to be addressed, however, the list button after logging in works the way that it should...it lists the current users entries.
Work on making the rate my feature work.

This is the second project that I created for the project 2 prompt.  StorWe, my first project 2 proved to be more complicated than I was ready to take on earlier in the program, so this project is like a clean start.
