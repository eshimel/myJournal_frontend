#MyJournal The App

##Use MyJournal as a tool to keep a personal account of the what's happening in your life.  You can  pull up a list of all of your entries, delete previous entries, and rename an entry, if your writing goes in a different direction than when you first started your post.  Sorry, no going back in and editing a post.  It’s like a paper journal, you'll just have to "rip out the page" by deleting it.  A future feature will be the “rate my day” quick post, that gives users the option to give a quick 1-10 rating of how they feel their day is going.
This app was inspired by an area art therapy organization’s daily check-in/check-out protocols that I spent the last year prior to becoming a developer working with.

#User Stories

As a user, the primary user, I need to be able to easily use the web console so that I can debug and troubleshoot the application that I am writing.
This frontend design of this app has been designed with using the bootstrap framework, specifically for a mobile app.  The reason is so that it was easier to see the workings of the app with the web console displayed larger.
As a user, the not me user, I need to see how the app works, so that I can decide whether to I want to register to use it.
